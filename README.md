# Ali Baba Assembling a Team

## Overview

The "Ali Baba Assembling a Team" project revolves around a strategic challenge faced by Ali Baba â€“ forming a team of thieves for a heist on a newly discovered cave. The task involves selecting a contiguous group of thieves from a line of available candidates to join his team, while aiming to minimize the overall cost associated with their participation. Each thief has an associated cost, which can be either positive (Ali Baba has to pay them), negative (they pay Ali Baba), or zero (no cost).

## Problem Statement

Ali Baba needs to assemble a team of thieves to maximize his profit. He must consider the costs associated with each thief's involvement and choose a group that will result in the lowest possible cost. The constraints require that the chosen group must be consecutive, which means Ali Baba can only select a group of adjacent thieves in the line.

## Key Features

- **Team Formation**: Develop an algorithm to select a contiguous group of thieves from the line to form the team.

- **Cost Calculation**: Calculate the total cost of the selected team, factoring in the costs associated with each member.

- **Minimization Strategy**: Design a strategy to minimize the overall cost of the chosen team, ensuring that Ali Baba either maximizes his profit or minimizes his expenses.

## Implementation

The project will involve the following steps:

1. **Input**: Receive the number of thieves (N) and their associated costs as input.

2. **Algorithm Design**: Create an efficient algorithm that determines the contiguous group of thieves with the lowest total cost.

3. **Team Formation**: Implement the algorithm to form the team based on minimizing costs.

4. **Output**: Display the selected group and its associated minimum cost.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in the "Ali Baba Assembling a Team" project, participants will achieve the following learning objectives:

- Develop problem-solving skills by tackling a real-world scenario with constraints.

- Gain experience in algorithm design, optimization, and efficient group selection.

- Understand the importance of cost optimization and decision-making in resource allocation scenarios.

## Outcome

Upon completion, participants will have a functional "Ali Baba Assembling a Team" algorithm that showcases their ability to make strategic decisions while optimizing costs. This project highlights skills in algorithmic thinking, problem-solving, and efficient utilization of resources, which are essential in various domains of computer science, finance, and operations management.
