# Ali Baba Assembling a Team
 The "Ali Baba Assembling a Team" project revolves around a strategic challenge faced by Ali Baba â€“ forming a team of thieves for a heist on a newly discovered cave. The task involves selecting a contiguous group of thieves from a line of available candidates to join his team, while aiming to minimize the overall cost associated with their participation. Each thief has an associated cost, which can be either positive (Ali Baba has to pay them), negative (they pay Ali Baba), or zero (no cost).
